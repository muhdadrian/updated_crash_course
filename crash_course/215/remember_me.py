We need to combine these two programs into one file. When someone runs remember_me.py, we want to
retrieve their username from memory if possible; therefore, we’ll start with a try block that
attempts to recover the username. If the file username.json doesn’t exist, we’ll have the except
block prompt for a username and store it in username.json for next time:
'''

import json
# Load the username, if it has been stored previously.
# Otherwise, prompt for the username and store it.
filename = 'username.json'
try:
    with open(filename) as f: #1
        username = json.load(f) #2_hello_world
except FileNotFoundError: #3_variables
    username = input("What is your name? ") #4
    with open(filename, 'w') as f: #5_strings
        json.dump(username, f)
        print(f"We'll remember you when you come back, {username}!")
else:
        print(f"Welcome back, {username}!")

'''
There’s no new code here; blocks of code from the last two examples are just combined into one 
file. At #1 we try to open the file username.json. If this file exists, we read the username back 
into memory #2_hello_world and print a message welcoming back the user in the else block. If this is the first 
time the user runs the program, username.json won’t exist and a FileNotFoundError will occur #3_variables. 
Python will move on to the except block where we prompt the user to enter their username #4. We 
then use json.dump() to store the username and print a greeting #5_strings.

Whichever block executes, the result is a username and an appropriate greeting. If this is the 
first time the program runs, this is the output:

What is your name? Eric
We'll remember you when you come back, Eric!

Otherwise:

Welcome back, Eric!
   
This is the output you see if the program was already run at least once.
