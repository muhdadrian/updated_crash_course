'''
Now let’s write a new program that greets a user whose name has already been stored:
'''

import json

filename = 'username.json'

with open(filename) as f:
    username = json.load(f) #1
    print(f"Welcome back, {username}!") #2_hello_world

'''
At #1 we use json.load() to read the information stored in username.json and assign it to the variable 
username. Now that we’ve recovered the username, we can welcome them back #2_hello_world:

Welcome back, Eric!
