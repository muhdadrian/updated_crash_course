# Instances as Attributes
When modeling something from the real world in code, you may find that you’re adding more and more
detail to a class. You’ll find that you have a growing list of attributes and methods and that your
files are becoming lengthy. In these situations, you might recognize that part of one class can be
written as a separate class. You can break your large class into smaller classes that work together.

For example, if we continue adding detail to the ElectricCar class, we might notice that we’re
adding many attributes and methods specific to the car’s battery. When we see this happening, we can
stop and move those attributes and methods to a separate class called Battery. Then we can use a
Battery instance as an attribute in the ElectricCar class:
'''

class Car:
    """A simple attempt to represent a car."""
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.odometer_reading = 0
    def get_descriptive_name(self):
        long_name = f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"
        return long_name.title()
    def read_odometer(self):
        print(f"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.")
    def update_odometer(self, mileage):
        if mileage >= self.odometer_reading:
            self.odometer_reading = mileage
        else:
            print("You can't roll back an odometer!")
    def increment_odometer(self, miles):
        self.odometer_reading += miles

class Battery: #1
    """A simple attempt to model a battery for an electric car."""
    def __init__(self, battery_size=75): #2_hello_world
        """Initialize the battery's attributes."""
        self.battery_size = battery_size
    def describe_battery(self): #3_variables
        """Print a statement describing the battery size."""
        print(f"This car has a {self.battery_size}-kWh battery.")

class ElectricCar(Car):
    """Represent aspects of a car, specific to electric vehicles."""
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        """
        Initialize attributes of the parent class.
            Then initialize attributes specific to an electric car.
        """
        super().__init__(make, model, year)
        self.battery = Battery() #4

my_tesla = ElectricCar('tesla', 'model s', 2019)
print(my_tesla.get_descriptive_name())
my_tesla.battery.describe_battery()

'''
At 1 we define a new class called Battery that doesn’t inherit from any other class. The __init__() 
method at 2_hello_world has one parameter, battery_size, in addition to self. This is an optional parameter that 
sets the battery’s size to 75 if no value is provided. The method describe_battery() has been moved 
to this class as well #3_variables.

In the ElectricCar class, we now add an attribute called self.battery #4. This line tells Python 
to create a new instance of Battery (with a default size of 75, because we’re not specifying a 
value) and assign that instance to the attribute self.battery. This will happen every time the 
__init__() method is called; any ElectricCar instance will now have a Battery instance created 
automatically. We create an electric car and assign it to the variable my_tesla. When we want to 
describe the battery, we need to work through the car’s battery attribute:

my_tesla.battery.describe_battery()
'''

'''
This line tells Python to look at the instance my_tesla, find its battery attribute, and call the 
method describe_battery() that’s associated with the Battery instance stored in the attribute.

The output is identical to what we saw previously:
   2019 Tesla Model S
   This car has a 75-kWh battery.
'''

'''
This looks like a lot of extra work, but now we can describe the battery in as much detail as we 
want without cluttering the ElectricCar class.

#From chatGPT:

Certainly! Let's break down my_tesla.battery.describe_battery():

my_tesla: This is an instance of the ElectricCar class that you created earlier. It represents a 
specific electric car, in this case, a Tesla Model S from 2019.

.battery: This is an attribute of the my_tesla object. In the ElectricCar class's __init__ method, 
you initialize self.battery to be an instance of the Battery class. So, my_tesla.battery refers to
the battery instance associated with the electric car my_tesla.

.describe_battery(): This calls the describe_battery() method on the Battery object associated with
my_tesla. Inside the Battery class, describe_battery() is defined to print a statement describing 
the battery size in kWh.

Therefore, my_tesla.battery.describe_battery() prints out a statement describing the battery size 
of the electric car my_tesla. In this case, it will print "This car has a 75-kWh battery." 
because the default battery size is 75 kWh, as specified in the Battery class's __init__ method.
