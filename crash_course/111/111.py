#1 - the value associated with each name is now a list. Notice that some people have one favorite
language and others have multiple favorites. When we loop through the dictionary at #2_hello_world, we use the
variable name languages to hold each value from the dictionary, because we know that each value 
will be a list. Inside the main dictionary loop, we use another for loop at #3_variables to run through each
person's list of favorite languages.
