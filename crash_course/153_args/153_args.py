# Mixing Positional and Arbitrary Arguments

'''
If you want a function to accept several different kinds of arguments, the parameter that accepts an
arbitrary number of arguments must be placed last in the function definition. Python matches
positional and keyword arguments first and then collects any remaining arguments in the final
parameter.
For example, if the function needs to take in a size for the pizza, that parameter must come before
the parameter *toppings:
'''

def make_pizza(size, *toppings):
    """Summarize the pizza we are about to make."""
    print(f"\nMaking a {size}-inch pizza with the following toppings:")
    for topping in toppings:
        print(f"- {topping}")
make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')
make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

'''
In the function definition, Python assigns the first value it receives to the parameter size. All 
other values that come after are stored in the tuple toppings. The function calls include an 
argument for the size first, followed by as many toppings as needed.

Now each pizza has a size and a number of toppings, and each piece of information is printed in 
the proper place, showing size first and toppings after:

You’ll often see the generic parameter name *args, which collects arbitrary positional arguments 
like this.
