Testing the AnonymousSurvey Class
Let’s write a test that verifies one aspect of the way AnonymousSurvey behaves. We’ll write a test
to verify that a single response to the survey question is stored properly. We’ll use the assertIn()
method to verify that the response is in the list of responses after it’s been stored:
'''

import unittest
from survey import AnonymousSurvey

class TestAnonymousSurvey(unittest.TestCase): #1
    """Tests for the class AnonymousSurvey"""

    def test_store_single_response(self): #2
        """Test that a single response is stored properly."""
        question = "What language did you first learn to speak?"
        my_survey = AnonymousSurvey(question) #3
        my_survey.store_response('English')
        self.assertIn('English', my_survey.responses) #4

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

'''
We start by importing the unittest module and the class we want to test, AnonymousSurvey. We call 
our test case TestAnonymousSurvey, which again inherits from unittest.TestCase #1. The first test 
method will verify that when we store a response to the survey question, the response ends up in 
the survey’s list of responses. A good descriptive name for this method is 
test_store_single_response() #2. If this test fails, we’ll know from the method name shown in the 
output of the failing test that there was a problem stor- ing a single response to the survey.

To test the behavior of a class, we need to make an instance of the class. At #3 we create an 
instance called my_survey with the question "What language did you first learn to speak?" We store 
a single response, English, using the store_response() method. Then we verify that the response 
was stored correctly by asserting that English is in the list my_survey.responses #4.

When we run test_survey.py, the test passes:

OK

This is good, but a survey is useful only if it generates more than one response. Let’s verify 
that three responses can be stored correctly. To do this, we add another method to 
TestAnonymousSurvey in 227:
