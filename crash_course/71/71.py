# Boolean Expression

# Boolean values are often used to keep track of certain conditions, such as whether a game is running
# or whether a user can edit certain content on a website:

game_active = True
can_edit = False

# Boolean values provide an efficient way to track the state of a program or a particular condition
# that is important in your program.
