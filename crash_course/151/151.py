# Passing an Arbitrary Number of Arguments

'''
Python allows a function to collect an arbitrary number of arguments from the calling statement
For example, consider a function that builds a pizza. It needs to accept a number of toppings, but
you can’t know ahead of time how many toppings a person will want. The function in the following
example has one parameter, *toppings, but this parameter collects as many arguments as the
calling line provides:
'''

def make_pizza(*toppings):
    """Print the list of toppings that have been requested."""
    print(toppings)
make_pizza('pepperoni')
make_pizza('mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

'''
The asterisk in the parameter name *toppings tells Python to make an empty tuple called toppings 
and pack whatever values it receives into this tuple. The print() call in the function body 
produces output showing that Python can handle a function call with one value and a call with 
three values. It treats the different calls similarly. Note that Python packs the arguments into a 
tuple, even if the function receives only one value:
