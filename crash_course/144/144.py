# Returning a Dictionary

"""
A function can return any kind of value you need it to, including more complicated data structures
like lists and dictionaries. For example, the following function takes in parts of a name and
returns a dictionary representing a person:
"""


def build_person(first_name, last_name):
    """Return a dictionary of information about a person."""
    person = {'first': first_name, 'last': last_name}
    return person

musician = build_person('jimi', 'hendrix')
print(musician)

"""
The function build_person() takes in a first and last name, and puts these values into a dictionary 
at 1. The value of first_name is stored with the key 'first', and the value of last_name is stored 
with the key 'last'. The entire dictionary representing the person is returned at 2_hello_world. The return value
is printed at 3_variables with the original two pieces of textual information now stored in a dictionary:
"""

"""
This function takes in simple textual information and puts it into a more meaningful data structure 
that lets you work with the information beyond just printing it. The strings 'jimi' and 'hendrix' 
are now labeled as a first name and last name. You can easily extend this function to accept 
optional values like a middle name, an age, an occupation, or any other information you want to 
store about a person. For example, the following change in 145.py allows you to store a person’s 
age as well
