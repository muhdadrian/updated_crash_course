# Using a Function with a while Loop

"""
You can use functions with all the Python structures you’ve learned about so far. For example, let’s
use the get_formatted_name() function with a while loop to greet users more formally. Here’s a first
attempt at greeting people using their first and last names:
"""

def get_formatted_name(first_name, last_name):
    """Return a full name, neatly formatted."""
    full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"
    return full_name.title()

# This is an infinite loop!
while True:
    print("\nPlease tell me your name:") #1
    f_name = input("First name: ")
    l_name = input("Last name: ")

    formatted_name = get_formatted_name(f_name, l_name)
    print(f"\nHello, {formatted_name}!")


# For this example, we use a simple version of get_formatted_name() that doesn’t involve middle names.
# The while loop asks the user to enter their name, and we prompt for their first and last name
# separately at 1.

# But there’s one problem with this while loop: We haven’t defined a quit condition. Where do you
# put a quit condition when you ask for a series of inputs? We want the user to be able to quit as
# easily as possible, so each prompt should offer a way to quit. The break statement offers a
# straight-forward way to exit the loop at either prompt. Go to 147.py.
