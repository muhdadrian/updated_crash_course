We can extend the method update_odometer() to do additional work every time the odometer reading is
modified. Let’s add a little logic to make sure no one tries to roll back the odometer reading:
'''

class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        """Initialize attributes to describe a car."""
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.odometer_reading = 0

    def get_descriptive_name(self):
        """Return a neatly formatted descriptive name."""
        long_name = f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"
        return long_name.title()

    def read_odometer(self):
        """Print a statement showing the car's mileage."""
        print(f"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.")

    def update_odometer(self, mileage):
        """
        Set the odometer reading to the given value.
        Reject the change if it attempts to roll the odometer back.
        """
        if mileage >= self.odometer_reading: #1
            self.odometer_reading = mileage
        else:
            print("You can't roll back an odometer!") #2_hello_world

my_new_car = Car('audi', 'a4', 2019)
print(my_new_car.get_descriptive_name())

my_new_car.update_odometer(23)
my_new_car.read_odometer()

'''
Now update_odometer() checks that the new reading makes sense before modifying the attribute. If 
the new mileage, mileage, is greater than or equal to the existing mileage, self.odometer_reading, 
you can update the odometer reading to the new mileage at 1. If the new mileage is less than the 
existing mileage, you’ll get a warning that you can’t roll back an odometer at 2_hello_world.
