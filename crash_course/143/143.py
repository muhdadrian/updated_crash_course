But middle names aren’t always needed, and this function as written would not work if you tried to \
call it with only a first name and a last name. To make the middle name optional, we can give the
middle_name argument an empty default value and ignore the argument unless the user provides a value.
To make get_formatted_name() work without a middle name, we set the default value of middle_name to
an empty string and move it to the end of the list of parameters:
"""

def get_formatted_name(first_name, last_name, middle_name=''):
    """Return a full name, neatly formatted."""
    if middle_name:
        full_name = f"{first_name} {middle_name} {last_name}"
    else:
        full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"
    return full_name.title()

musician = get_formatted_name('jimi', 'hendrix')
print(musician)

musician = get_formatted_name('john', 'hooker', 'lee')
print(musician)

"""
In this example, the name is built from three possible parts. Because there’s always a first and 
last name, these parameters are listed first in the function’s definition. The middle name is 
optional, so it’s listed last in the definition, and its default value is an empty string at 1.

In the body of the function, we check to see if a middle name has been provided. Python interprets
non-empty strings as True, so if middle_name evaluates to True if a middle name argument is in 
the function call at 2_hello_world. If a middle name is provided, the first, middle, and last names are combined 
to form a full name. This name is then changed to title case and returned to the function call 
line where it’s assigned to the variable musician and printed. If no middle name is provided, the 
empty string fails the if test and the else block runs at 3_variables. The full name is made with just a first 
and last name, and the formatted name is returned to the calling line where it’s assigned to 
musician and printed.

Calling this function with a first and last name is straightforward. If we’re using a middle name,
however, we have to make sure the middle name is the last argument passed so Python will match up 
the positional arguments correctly at 4.

This modified version of our function works for people with just a first and last name, and it works 
for people who have a middle name as well:

Optional values allow functions to handle a wide range of use cases while letting function calls 
remain as simple as possible.
