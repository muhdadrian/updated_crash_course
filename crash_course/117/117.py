# Using int() to Accept Numerical Input
# When you use the input() function, Python interprets everything the user enters as a string.

age = input("How old are you?")
print(age)

"""
The user enters the number 21 for example, but when we ask Python for the value of age, it returns 
'21', the string representation of the numerical value entered. We know Python interpreted the input
as a string because the number is now enclosed in quotes. If all you want to do is print the input,
this works well. But if you try to use the input as a number, you'll get an error:
"""

print(age >= 18) # 1

"""
When you try to use the input to do a numerical comparison at 1, Python produces an error because it 
can’t compare a string to an integer: the string '21' that’s assigned to age can’t be compared to 
the numerical value 18_introducing_lists.

We can resolve this issue by using the int() function, which tells Python to treat the input as a 
numerical value. The int() function converts a string representation of a number to a numerical 
representation. Go to 118.py.
