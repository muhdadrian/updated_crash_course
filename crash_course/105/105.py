"""
As you continue learning about Python, you'll often find a built-in feature of the language that
helps you do exactly what you want with your data.

You can build a set directly using braces and separating the elements with commas:
"""

languages = {'python', 'ruby', 'python', 'c'}
print(languages)

"""
It's easy to mistake sets for dictionaries because they're both wrapped in braces. When you see
braces but no key-value pairs, you're probably looking at a set. Unlike lists and dictionaries,
sets do not retain items in any specific order.
