# How the input() Function Works

"""
The input() function pauses your program and waits for the user to enter some text. Once Python
receives the user's input, it assigns that input to a variable to make it convenient for you to work
with.

For example, the following program asks the user to enter some text, then displays that message back
to the user:
"""

message = input("Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: ")
print(message)

"""
The input() function takes one argument: the prompt, or instructions, that we want to display to the
user so they know what to do. In this example, when Python runs the first line, the user sees the 
prompt 'Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:'.

The program waits while the user enters their response and continues after the user presses ENTER.
The response is assigned to the variable message, then print(message) displays the input back to the
user.
