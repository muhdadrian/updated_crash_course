'''
You import multiple classes from a module by separating each class with a comma #1. Once you’ve 
imported the necessary classes, you’re free to make as many instances of each class as you need.
In this example we make a regular Volkswagen Beetle at #2_hello_world and an electric Tesla Roadster at #3_variables:

   2019 Volkswagen Beetle
   2019 Tesla Roadster
