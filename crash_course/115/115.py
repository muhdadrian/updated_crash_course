# Writing Clear Prompts

"""
Each time you use the input() function, you should include a clear, easy-to-follow prompt that tells
the user exactly what kind of information you're looking for. Any statement that tells the user what
to enter should work. For example:
"""

name = input("Please enter your name: ")
print(f"\nHello, {name}!")

"""
Add a space at the end of your prompts (after the colon in the preceding example) to separate the
prompt from the user's response and to make it clear to your user where to enter their text.
