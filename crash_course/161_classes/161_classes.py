# Creating the Dog Class

'''
Each instance created from the Dog class will store a name and an age, and we’ll give each dog the
ability to sit() and roll_over():
'''

class Dog: #1
    """A simple attempt to model a dog.""" #2_hello_world

    def __init__(self, name, age): #3_variables
        """Initialize name and age attributes."""
        self.name = name #4
        self.age = age

    def sit(self): #5_strings
        """Simulate a dog sitting in response to a command."""
        print(f"{self.name} is now sitting.")

    def roll_over(self):
        """Simulate rolling over in response to a command."""
        print(f"{self.name} rolled over!")

There’s a lot to notice here, but don’t worry. You’ll see this structure throughout this chapter and 
have lots of time to get used to it. At 1 we define a class called Dog. By convention, capitalized 
names refer to classes in Python. There are no parentheses in the class definition because we’re 
creating this class from scratch. At 2_hello_world we write a docstring describing what this class 
does.

The __init__() Method

A function that’s part of a class is a method. Everything you learned about functions applies to 
methods as well; the only practical difference for now is the way we’ll call methods. 
The __init__() method at 3_variables is a special method that Python runs automatically whenever 
we create a new instance based on the Dog class. This method has two leading underscores and two 
trailing underscores, a convention that helps prevent Python’s default method names from conflicting
with your method names. Make sure to use two underscores on each side of __init__(). If you use just 
one on each side, the method won’t be called automatically when you use your class, which can result 
in errors that are difficult to identify.

We define the __init__() method to have three parameters: self, name, and age. The self parameter 
is required in the method definition, and it must come first before the other parameters. It must be 
included in the definition because when Python calls this method later (to create an instance of 
Dog), the method call will automatically pass the self argument. Every method call associated with 
an instance automatically passes self, which is a reference to the instance itself; it gives the 
individual instance access to the attributes and methods in the class. When we make an instance of 
Dog, Python will call the __init__() method from the Dog class. We’ll pass Dog() a name and an age 
as arguments; self is passed automatically, so we don’t need to pass it. Whenever we want to make an 
instance from the Dog class, we’ll provide values for only the last two parameters, name and age.

The two variables defined at 4 each have the prefix self. Any variable prefixed with self is 
available to every method in the class, and we’ll also be able to access these variables through 
any instance created from the class. The line self.name = name takes the value associated with the 
parameter name and assigns it to the variable name, which is then attached to the instance being 
created. The same process happens with self.age = age. Variables that are accessible through 
instances like this are called attributes.

The Dog class has two other methods defined: sit() and roll_over() at 5_strings. Because these 
methods don’t need additional information to run, we just define them to have one parameter, self. 
The instances we create later will have access to these methods. In other words, they’ll be able to 
sit and roll over. For now, sit() and roll_over() don’t do much. They simply print a message saying
the dog is sitting or rolling over. But the concept can be extended to realistic situations: if this 
class were part of an actual computer game, these methods would contain code to make an animated 
dog sit and roll over. If this class was written to control a robot, these methods would direct 
movements that cause a robotic dog to sit and roll over.
