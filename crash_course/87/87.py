# You can have an unlimited number of key-value pairs in a dictionary.
# From the code below, you can access either the color of the point value of alien_0.

alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}

new_points = alien_0['points']# 1
print(f"You just earned {new_points} points!")# 2

# Once the dictionary has been defined, the code at 1 pulls the value associated with the key 'points'
# from the dictionary. This value is then assigned to the variable new_points. The line at 2 prints
# statement about how many points the player just earned.
