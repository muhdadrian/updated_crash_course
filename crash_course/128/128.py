Using a while Loop with Lists and Dictionaries
A for loop is effective for looping through a list, but you shouldn’t modify a list inside a for loop
because Python will have trouble keeping track of the items in the list.
To modify a list as you work through it, use a while loop. Using while loops with lists and
dictionaries allows you to collect, store, and organize lots of input to examine and report on later.
"""

# Moving Items from One List to Another:

# Start with users that need to be verified,
# and an empty list to hold confirmed users.
unconfirmed_users = ['alice', 'brian', 'candace'] #1
confirmed_users = []

# Verify each user until there are no more unconfirmed users.
# Move each verified user into the list of confirmed users.
while unconfirmed_users: #2
    current_user = unconfirmed_users.pop() #3

    print(f"Verifying user: {current_user.title()}")
    confirmed_users.append(current_user) #4

# Display all confirmed users.
print("\nThe following users have been confirmed:")
for confirmed_user in confirmed_users:
    print(confirmed_user.title())

"""
We begin with a list of unconfirmed users at 1 (Alice, Brian, and Candace) and an empty list to hold
confirmed users. The while loop at 2 runs as long as the list unconfirmed_users is not empty. Within
this loop, the pop() function at 3 removes unverified users one at a time from the end of 
unconfirmed_users. Here, because Candace is last in the unconfirmed_users list, her name will be the
first to be removed, assigned to current_user, and added to the confirmed_users list at 4. Next is 
Brian, then Alice.

We simulate confirming each user by printing a verification message and then adding them to the list
of confirmed users. As the list of unconfirmed users shrinks, the list of confirmed users grows.
When the list of unconfirmed users is empty, the loop stops and the list of confirmed users is 
printed.
