# Overriding Methods from the Parent Class
You can override any method from the parent class that doesn’t fit what you’re trying to model with
the child class. To do this, you define a method in the child class with the same name as the method
you want to override in the parent class. Python will disregard the parent class method and only pay
attention to the method you define in the child class.

Say the class Car had a method called fill_gas_tank(). This method is meaningless for an all-electric
vehicle, so you might want to override this method. Here’s one way to do that:
'''

class Car:
    """A simple attempt to represent a car."""
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.odometer_reading = 0
    def get_descriptive_name(self):
        long_name = f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"
        return long_name.title()
    def read_odometer(self):
        print(f"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.")
    def update_odometer(self, mileage):
        if mileage >= self.odometer_reading:
            self.odometer_reading = mileage
        else:
            print("You can't roll back an odometer!")
    def increment_odometer(self, miles):
        self.odometer_reading += miles

class ElectricCar(Car):
    """Represent aspects of a car, specific to electric vehicles."""
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        """
        Initialize attributes of the parent class.
        Then initialize attributes specific to an electric car.
        """
        super().__init__(make, model, year)
        self.battery_size = 75 #1

    def describe_battery(self): #2_hello_world
        """Print a statement describing the battery size."""
        print(f"This car has a {self.battery_size}-kWh battery.")

    def fill_gas_tank(self):
        """Electric cars don't have gas tanks."""
        print("This car doesn't need a gas tank!")

my_tesla = ElectricCar('tesla', 'model s', 2019)
print(my_tesla.get_descriptive_name())
my_tesla.describe_battery()
my_tesla.fill_gas_tank()

'''
Now if someone tries to call fill_gas_tank() with an electric car, Python will ignore the method 
fill_gas_tank() in Car and run this code instead. When you use inheritance, you can make your 
child classes retain what you need and override anything you don’t need from the parent class.
