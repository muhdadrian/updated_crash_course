# Using Arbitrary Keyword Arguments

'''
Sometimes you’ll want to accept an arbitrary number of arguments, but you won’t know ahead of time
what kind of information will be passed to the function. In this case, you can write functions that
accept as many key-value pairs as the calling statement provides. One example involves building user
profiles: you know you’ll get information about a user, but you’re not sure what kind of information
you’ll receive. The function build_profile() in the following example always takes in a first and
last name, but it accepts an arbitrary number of keyword arguments as well:
'''

def build_profile(first, last, **user_info):
    """Build a dictionary containing everything we know about a user."""
    user_info['first_name'] = first #1
    user_info['last_name'] = last
    return user_info


user_profile = build_profile('albert', 'einstein',
                             location='princeton',
                             field='physics')
print(user_profile)

'''
The definition of build_profile() expects a first and last name, and then it allows the user to 
pass in as many name-value pairs as they want. The double asterisks before the parameter **user_info 
cause Python to create an empty dictionary called user_info and pack whatever name-value pairs it 
receives into this dictionary. Within the function, you can access the key- value pairs in user_info 
just as you would for any dictionary.

In the body of build_profile(), we add the first and last names to the user_info dictionary because 
we’ll always receive these two pieces of information from the user at 1, and they haven’t been 
placed into the dictionary yet. Then we return the user_info dictionary to the function call line.

We call build_profile(), passing it the first name 'albert', the last name 'einstein', and the two 
key-value pairs location='princeton' and field='physics'. We assign the returned profile to 
user_profile and print user_profile.
'''

'''
The returned dictionary contains the user’s first and last names and, in this case, the location and 
field of study as well. The function would work no matter how many additional key-value pairs are 
provided in the function call.

You can mix positional, keyword, and arbitrary values in many different ways when writing your own 
functions. It’s useful to know that all these argument types exist because you’ll see them often when 
you start reading other people’s code. It takes practice to learn to use the different types 
correctly and to know when to use each type. For now, remember to use the simplest approach that 
gets the job done. As you progress you’ll learn to use the most efficient approach each time.

# You’ll often see the parameter name **kwargs used to collect non-specific keyword arguments.
