# Equivalent Function Calls

"""
Because positional arguments, keyword arguments, and default values can all be used together, often
you’ll have several equivalent ways to call a function. Consider the following definition for
describe_pet() with one default value provided:
"""

def describe_pet(pet_name, animal_type='dog'):

    """
    With this definition, an argument always needs to be provided for pet_name, and this value can be
    provided using the positional or keyword format. If the animal being described is not a dog, an
    argument for animal_type must be included in the call, and this argument can also be specified using
    the positional or keyword format.

    All of the following calls would work for this function:
    """

# A dog named Willie.
describe_pet('willie')
describe_pet(pet_name='willie')

# A hamster named Harry.
describe_pet('harry', 'hamster')
describe_pet(pet_name='harry', animal_type='hamster')
describe_pet(animal_type='hamster', pet_name='harry')

# Each of these function calls would have the same output as the previous examples.

"""
It doesn’t really matter which calling style you use. As long as your function calls produce the 
output you want, just use the style you find easiest to understand.
