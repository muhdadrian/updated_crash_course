It's common to store a number of dictionaries in a list when each dictionary contains many kinds of
information about one object. For example, you might create a dictionary for each user on a website,
and store the individual dictionaries in a list called users.

All of the dictionaries in the list should have an identical structure so you can loop through 
the list and work with each dictionary object in the same way.
