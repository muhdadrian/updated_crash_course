Failing Silently
In the previous example, we informed our users that one of the files
was unavailable. But you don’t need to report every exception you catch. Sometimes you’ll want the
program to fail silently when an exception occurs and continue on as if nothing happened. To make
a program fail silently, you write a try block as usual, but you explicitly tell Python to do
nothing in the except block. Python has a pass statement that tells it to do nothing in a block:
'''
def count_words(filename):
    """Count the approximate number of words in a file.""" #1
    try:
        with open(filename, encoding='utf-8') as f:
            contents = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass #1
    else:
        words = contents.split()
        num_words = len(words)
        print(f"The file {filename} has about {num_words} words.")


filenames = ['syukuri.txt', 'tiada.txt', 'learn.txt', 'tujuan_hidup.txt']
for filename in filenames:
    count_words(filename)

'''
The only difference between this listing and the previous one is the pass statement at #1. Now when 
a FileNotFoundError is raised, the code in the except block runs, but nothing happens. No traceback
is produced, and there’s no output in response to the error that was raised. Users see the word 
counts for each file that exists, but they don’t see any indication that a file wasn’t found:
'''

'''
The pass statement also acts as a placeholder. It’s a reminder that you’re choosing to do nothing 
at a specific point in your program’s execution and that you might want to do something there later. 
For example, in this program we might decide to write any missing filenames to a file called 
missing_files.txt. Our users wouldn’t see this file, but we’d be able to read the file and deal with 
any missing texts.

Deciding Which Errors to Report
How do you know when to report an error to your users and when to fail silently? If users know which
texts are supposed to be analyzed, they might appreciate a message informing them why some texts 
were not analyzed. If users expect to see some results but don’t know which books are supposed to be
analyzed, they might not need to know that some texts were unavailable. Giving users information 
they aren’t looking for can decrease the usability of your program. Python’s error-handling 
structures give you fine-grained control over how much to share with users when things go wrong; 
it’s up to you to decide how much information to share.

Well-written, properly tested code is not very prone to internal errors, such as syntax or logical
errors. But every time your program depends on something external, such as user input, the existence
of a file, or the availability of a network connection, there is a possibility of an exception 
being raised. A little experience will help you know where to include exception handling blocks 
in your program and how much to report to users about errors that arise.
