"""
Calling a function multiple times is a very efficient way to work. The code describing a pet is 
written once in the function. Then, anytime you want to describe a new pet, you call the function
with the new pet’s information. Even if the code for describing a pet were to expand to ten lines,
you could still describe a new pet in just one line by calling the function again.
