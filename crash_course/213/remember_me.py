Saving and Reading User-Generated Data
Saving data with json is useful when you’re working with user-generated data, because if you don’t
store your user’s information somehow, you’ll lose it when the program stops running. Let’s look at
an example where we prompt the user for their name the first time they run a program and then
remember their name when they run the program again.

Let’s start by storing the user’s name:
'''

import json

username = input("What is your name? ") #1

filename = 'username.json'
with open(filename, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(username, f) #2_hello_world
    print(f"We'll remember you when you come back, {username}!") #3_variables

'''
At #1 we prompt for a username to store. Next, we use json.dump(), passing it a username and a file 
object, to store the username in a file #2_hello_world. Then we print a message informing the user that we’ve 
stored their information #3_variables:

What is your name? Eric
We'll remember you when you come back, Eric!
