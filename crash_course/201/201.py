Using Exceptions to Prevent Crashes
Handling errors correctly is especially important when the program has more work to do after the
error occurs. This happens often in programs that prompt users for input. If the program responds to
invalid input appropriately, it can prompt for more valid input instead of crashing.
Let’s create a simple calculator that does only division:
'''

print("Give me two numbers, and I'll divide them.")
print("Enter 'q' to quit.")

while True:
    first_number = input("\nFirst number: ")
    if first_number == 'q':
        break
    second_number = input("Second number: ")
    if second_number == 'q':
        break
    answer = int(first_number) / int(second_number)
    print(answer)

This program does nothing to handle errors, so asking it to divide by zero causes it to crash:
