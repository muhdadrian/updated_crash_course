Analyzing Text
Let’s pull in the text of Alice in Wonderland and try to count the number of words in the text.
We’ll use the string method split(), which can build a list of words from a string. Here’s what
split() does with a string containing just the title "Alice in Wonderland":
'''

title = "Alice in Wonderland"
print(title.split())

'''
>>> title = "Alice in Wonderland" 
>>> title.split()
['Alice', 'in', 'Wonderland']
'''

'''
The split() method separates a string into parts wherever it finds a space and stores all the parts
of the string in a list. The result is a list of words from the string, although some punctuation 
may also appear with some of the words.
