"""
The Modulo Operator:
A useful tool for working with numerical information is the modulo operator (%), which divides one
number by another number and returns the remainder:
"""

print(4 % 3)
print(5 % 3)
print(6 % 3)
print(7 % 3)

"""
The modulo operator tells you what the remainder is. When one number is divisible by another 
number, the remainder is 0, so the modulo operator always returns 0. You can use this fact to 
determine if a number is even or odd:
"""

number = input("Enter a number, and I'll tell you if it's even or odd: ")
number = int(number)
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"\nThe number {number} is even.")
else:
    print(f"\nThe number {number} is odd.")
