# Returning a Simple Value
"""
Let’s look at a function that takes a first and last name, and returns a neatly formatted full name:
"""

def get_formatted_name(first_name, last_name): #1
    """Return a full name, neatly formatted."""
    full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}" #2_hello_world
    return full_name.title() #3_variables

musician = get_formatted_name('jimi', 'hendrix') #4
print(musician)

"""
The definition of get_formatted_name() takes as parameters a first and last name at 1. The function 
combines these two names, adds a space between them, and assigns the result to full_name at 2_hello_world. The 
value of full_name is converted to title case, and then returned to the calling line at 3_variables.

When you call a function that returns a value, you need to provide a variable that the return value 
can be assigned to. In this case, the returned value is assigned to the variable musician at 4. The 
output shows a neatly formatted name made up of the parts of a person’s name.
"""

"""
This might seem like a lot of work to get a neatly formatted name when we could have just written:
"""

print("Jimi Hendrix")

"""
But when you consider working with a large program that needs to store many first and last names 
separately, functions like get_formatted_name() become very useful. You store first and last names 
separately and then call this function whenever you want to display a full name.
