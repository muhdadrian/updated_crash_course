# Modifying a List in a Function

'''
When you pass a list to a function, the function can modify the list. Any changes made to the list
inside the function’s body are permanent, allowing you to work efficiently even when you’re dealing
with large amounts of data.

Consider a company that creates 3D printed models of designs that users submit. Designs that need to
be printed are stored in a list, and after being printed they’re moved to a separate list. The
following code does this without using functions:
'''

# Start with some designs that need to be printed.
unprinted_designs = ['phone case', 'robot pendant', 'dodecahedron']
completed_models = []
# Simulate printing each design, until none are left.
# Move each design to completed_models after printing.
while unprinted_designs:
       current_design = unprinted_designs.pop()
       print(f"Printing model: {current_design}")
       completed_models.append(current_design)

# Display all completed models.
print("\nThe following models have been printed:")
for completed_model in completed_models:
    print(completed_model)

'''
This program starts with a list of designs that need to be printed and an empty list called 
completed_models that each design will be moved to after it has been printed. As long as designs 
remain in unprinted_designs, the while loop simulates printing each design by removing a design 
from the end of the list, storing it in current_design, and displaying a message that the current 
design is being printed. It then adds the design to the list of completed models. When the loop is 
finished running, a list of the designs that have been printed is displayed:
'''

'''
We can reorganize this code by writing two functions, each of which does one specific job. Most of 
the code won’t change; we’re just making it more carefully structured. The first function will 
handle printing the designs, and the second will summarize the prints that have been made at 150.py:
