# Passing a List

'''
You’ll often find it useful to pass a list to a function, whether it’s a list of names, numbers,
or more complex objects, such as dictionaries. When you pass a list to a function, the function gets
direct access to the contents of the list. Let’s use functions to make working with lists more
efficient.

Say we have a list of users and want to print a greeting to each. The following example sends a list
of names to a function called greet_users(), which greets each person in the list individually:
'''

def greet_users(names):
    """Print a simple greeting to each user in the list."""
    for name in names:
        msg = f"Hello, {name.title()}!"
        print(msg)

usernames = ['hannah', 'ty', 'margot'] #1
greet_users(usernames)

'''
We define greet_users() so it expects a list of names, which it assigns to the parameter names. 
The function loops through the list it receives and prints a greeting to each user. At 1 we define a 
list of users and then pass the list usernames to greet_users() in our function call:
'''

'''
This is the output we wanted. Every user sees a personalized greeting, and you can call the 
function any time you want to greet a specific set of users.

# My Solution:

def greet_user(names):
    """greet each user"""
    for name in names:
        msg = f"Hello, {name.title()}!"
        print(msg)

greet = greet_user(['hannah', 'ty', 'margot'])

or, 

greet_user(['hannah', 'ty', 'margot'])
