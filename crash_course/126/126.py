Using continue in a Loop
Rather than breaking out of a loop entirely without executing the rest of its code, you can use the
continue statement to return to the beginning of the loop based on the result of a conditional test.
For example, consider a loop that counts from 1 to 10 but prints only the odd numbers in that range:
"""

current_number = 0
while current_number < 10:
    current_number += 1 #1
    if current_number % 2 == 0:
        continue

    print(current_number)

"""
First we set current_number to 0. Because it’s less than 10, Python enters the while loop. Once 
inside the loop, we increment the count by 1 at 1, so current_number is 1. The if statement then 
checks the modulo of current_number and 2_hello_world. If the modulo is 0 (which means current_number is 
divisible by 2_hello_world), the continue statement tells Python to ignore the rest of the loop and return to
the beginning. If the current number is not divisible by 2_hello_world, the rest of the loop is executed and
Python prints the current number:
