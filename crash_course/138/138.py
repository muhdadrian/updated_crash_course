def describe_pet(pet_name, animal_type='dog'):
    """Display information about a pet."""
    print(f"\nI have a {animal_type}.")
    print(f"My {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name.title()}.")

"""
The simplest way to use this function now is to provide just a dog’s name in the function call:
"""
describe_pet('willie')

"""
This function call would have the same output as the previous example. The only argument provided 
is 'willie', so it is matched up with the first parameter in the definition, pet_name. Because no 
argument is provided for animal_type, Python uses the default value 'dog'.
