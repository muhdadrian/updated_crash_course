# A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is connected to a value, and you
# can use a key to access the value associated with that key. A key's value can be a number, string,
# a list, or even another dictionary. In fact, you can use any object that you can create in Python
# as a value in a dictionary.
#
# Every key is connected to its value by a colon, and individual key-value pairs are separated by
# commas. You can store as many key-value pairs as you want in a dictionary.
#
# The simplest dictionary has exactly one key-value pair, as shown in this modified version of the
# alien_0 dictionary:

alien_0 = {'color': 'green'}

# The dictionary above stores one piece of information about alien_0, namely the alien's color.
# The string 'color' is a key in this dictionary, and its associated value is 'green'.
