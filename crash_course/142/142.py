# Making an Argument Optional

"""
Sometimes it makes sense to make an argument optional so that people using the function can choose to
provide extra information only if they want to. You can use default values to make an argument
optional.

For example, say we want to expand get_formatted_name() to handle middle names as well. A first
attempt to include middle names might look like this:
"""
def get_formatted_name(first_name, middle_name, last_name):
    """Return a full name, neatly formatted."""
    full_name = f"{first_name} {middle_name} {last_name}"
    return full_name.title()


musician = get_formatted_name('john', 'lee', 'hooker')
print(musician)

"""
This function works when given a first, middle, and last name. The function takes in all three parts 
of a name and then builds a string out of them. The function adds spaces where appropriate and 
converts the full name to title case:
