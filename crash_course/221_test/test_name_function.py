Here’s a test case with one method that verifies that the function get_formatted_name() works
correctly when given a first and last name:
'''

import unittest
from name_function import get_formatted_name

class NamesTestCase(unittest.TestCase): #1
    """Tests for 'name_function.py'."""

    def test_first_last_name(self):
        """Do names like 'Janis Joplin' work?"""
        formatted_name = get_formatted_name('janis', 'joplin') #2
        self.assertEqual(formatted_name, 'Janis Joplin') #3

if __name__ == '__main__': #4
    unittest.main()

'''
First, we import unittest and the function we want to test, get_formatted _name(). At #1 we create 
a class called NamesTestCase, which will contain a series of unit tests for get_formatted_name().
You can name the class anything you want, but it’s best to call it something related to the 
function you’re about to test and to use the word Test in the class name. This class must inherit 
from the class unittest.TestCase so Python knows how to run the tests you write.

NamesTestCase contains a single method that tests one aspect of get_formatted_name(). We call this 
method test_first_last_name() because we’re verifying that names with only a first and last name 
are formatted correctly. Any method that starts with test_ will be run automatically when we run 
test_name_function.py. Within this test method, we call the function we want to test. In this 
example we call get_formatted_name() with the arguments 'janis' and 'joplin', and assign the 
result to formatted_name at #2.

At #3 we use one of unittest’s most useful features: an assert method. Assert methods verify that a 
result you received matches the result you expected to receive. In this case, because we know 
get_formatted_name() is supposed to return a capitalized, properly spaced full name, we expect 
the value of formatted_name to be Janis Joplin. To check if this is true, we use unittest’s 
assertEqual() method and pass it formatted_name and 'Janis Joplin'. The line

self.assertEqual(formatted_name, 'Janis Joplin')

says, “Compare the value in formatted_name to the string 'Janis Joplin'. If they are equal as
expected, fine. But if they don’t match, let me know!”

We’re going to run this file directly, but it’s important to note that many testing frameworks 
import your test files before running them. When a file is imported, the interpreter executes the 
file as it’s being imported. The if block at #4 looks at a special variable, __name__, which is set 
when the program is executed. If this file is being run as the main program, the value
of __name__ is set to '__main__'. In this case, we call unittest.main(), which runs the test case.
When a testing framework imports this file, the value of __name__ won’t be '__main__' and this 
block will not be executed.

When we run test_name_function.py, we get the following output:
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s
OK

The dot on the first line of output tells us that a single test passed. The next line tells us that 
Python ran one test, and it took less than 0.001 seconds to run. The final OK tells us that all unit 
tests in the test case passed.

This output indicates that the function get_formatted_name() will always work for names that have 
a first and last name unless we modify the function. When we modify get_formatted_name(), we can 
run this test again. If the test case passes, we know the function will still work for names like 
Janis Joplin.

Chat GPT:

The line if __name__ == '__main__': is a common idiom in Python scripts. It ensures that the 
following code block is executed only if the script is run directly, and not if it is imported as a 
module into another script.

In the context of the test script provided earlier, this line ensures that when you directly 
execute the test script (by running python test_name_function.py in the command line), the 
unittest.main() function is called, which runs all the test cases defined in the script.

If you were to import this test script into another script, the unittest.main() function wouldn't 
be called automatically. This allows you to import and use the test cases defined in the script 
without executing them immediately.

So, in summary, if __name__ == '__main__': is a way to ensure that certain code runs only when the 
script is executed directly, but not when it's imported as a module.
