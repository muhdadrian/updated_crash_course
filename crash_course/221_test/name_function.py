Testing a Function
To learn about testing, we need code to test. Here’s a simple function that takes in a first and
last name, and returns a neatly formatted full name:
'''

def get_formatted_name(first, last):
    """Generate a neatly formatted full name."""
    full_name = f"{first} {last}"
    return full_name.title()

'''
The function get_formatted_name() combines the first and last name with a space in between to 
complete a full name, and then capitalizes and returns the full name. To check that 
get_formatted_name() works, let’s make a program that uses this function. The program test_name_function.py 
lets users enter a first and last name, and see a neatly formatted full name:
