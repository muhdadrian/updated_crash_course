The previous approach pulls all the values from the dictionary without checking for repeats.
That might work fine with a small number of values, but in a poll with a large number of
respondents, this would result in a very repetitive list. To see each language chosen without
repetition, we can use a set. A set is a collection in which each item must be unique:
"""

favorite_languages = {
    'jen': 'python',
    'sarah': 'c',
    'edward': 'ruby',
    'phil': 'python',
}

print("The following languages have been mentioned:")
for language in set(favorite_languages.values()): #1
    print(language.title())

"""
When you wrap set() around a list that contains duplicate items, Python identifies the unique items
in the list and builds a set from those items. At 1, we use set() to pull out the unique languages
in favorite_languages.values().

The result is a non-repetitive list of languages that have been mentioned by people taking the poll.
