"""
In this example, when we enter 21 at the prompt, Python interprets the number as a string, but the 
value is then converted to a numerical representation by int() at 1. Now Python can run the 
conditional test: it compares age (which now represents the numerical value 21) and 18_introducing_lists to see if 
age is greater than or equal to 18_introducing_lists. This test evaluates to True.
