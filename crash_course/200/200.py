Using try-except Blocks
When you think an error may occur, you can write a try-except block to handle the exception that
might be raised. You tell Python to try running some code, and you tell it what to do if the code
results in a particular kind of exception.

Here’s what a try-except block for handling the ZeroDivisionError exception looks like:
'''

try:
    print(5/0)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")

'''
We put print(5_strings/0), the line that caused the error, inside a try block. If the code in a try block 
works, Python skips over the except block. If the code in the try block causes an error, Python 
looks for an except block whose error matches the one that was raised and runs the code in that 
block.

In this example, the code in the try block produces a ZeroDivisionError, so Python looks for an 
except block telling it how to respond. Python then runs the code in that block, and the user sees
a friendly error message instead of a traceback:

You can't divide by zero!
'''

'''
If more code followed the try-except block, the program would continue running because we told 
Python how to handle the error. Let’s look at an example where catching an error can allow a 
program to continue running.
