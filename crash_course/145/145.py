"""
We add a new optional parameter age to the function definition and assign the parameter the 
special value None, which is used when a variable has no specific value assigned to it. You can 
think of None as a placeholder value. In conditional tests, None evaluates to False. If the function 
call includes a value for age, that value is stored in the dictionary. This function always stores 
a person’s name, but it can also be modified to store any other information you want about a person.
