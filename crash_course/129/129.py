# Removing All Instances of Specific Values from a List

"""
Before this, we used remove() to remove a specific value from a list. The remove() function worked
because the value we were interested in appeared only once in the list. But what if you want to
remove all instances of a value from a list?

Say you have a list of pets with the value 'cat' repeated several times. To remove all instances of
that value, you can run a while loop until 'cat' is no longer in the list, as shown here:
"""

pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'cat', 'rabbit', 'cat']
print(pets)

while 'cat' in pets:
    pets.remove('cat')

print(pets)

"""
We start with a list containing multiple instances of 'cat'. After printing the list, Python enters
the while loop because it finds the value 'cat' in the list at least once. Once inside the loop, 
Python removes the first instance of 'cat', returns to the while line, and then reenters the loop 
when it finds that 'cat' is still in the list. It removes each instance of 'cat' until the value is
no longer in the list, at which point Python exits the loop and prints the list again:
