A Failing Test
What does a failing test look like? Let’s modify get_formatted_name() so it can handle middle names,
but we’ll do so in a way that breaks the function for names with just a first and last name, like
Janis Joplin.

Here’s a new version of get_formatted_name() that requires a middle name argument:
'''


def get_formatted_name(first, middle, last):
    """Generate a neatly formatted full name."""
    full_name = f"{first} {middle} {last}"
    return full_name.title()

'''
This version should work for people with middle names, but when we test it, we see that we’ve 
broken the function for people with just a first and last name.
