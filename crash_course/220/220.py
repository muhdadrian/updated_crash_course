Unit Tests and Test Cases
The module unittest from the Python standard library provides tools for testing your code. A unit
test verifies that one specific aspect of a function’s behavior is correct. A test case is a
collection of unit tests that together prove that a function behaves as it’s supposed to, within
the full range of situations you expect it to handle. A good test case considers all the
possible kinds of input a function could receive and includes tests to represent each of these
situations. A test case with full coverage includes a full range of unit tests covering all the
possible ways you can use a function. Achieving full coverage on a large project can be daunting.
It’s often good enough to write tests for your code’s critical behaviors and then aim for full
coverage only if the project starts to see widespread use.

A Passing Test
The syntax for setting up a test case takes some getting used to, but once you’ve set up the test 
case it’s straightforward to add more unit tests for your functions. To write a test case for a 
function, import the unittest module and the function you want to test. Then create a class that 
inherits from unittest.TestCase, and write a series of methods to test different aspects of your 
function’s behavior.
