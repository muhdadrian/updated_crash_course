Appending to a File
If you want to add content to a file instead of writing over existing content, you can open the file
in append mode. When you open a file in append mode, Python doesn’t erase the contents of the file
before returning the file object. Any lines you write to the file will be added at the end of the
file. If the file doesn’t exist yet, Python will create an empty file for you.

Let’s modify write_message.py by adding some new reasons we love programming to the existing file
programming.txt:
'''

filename = 'programming.txt'
with open(filename, 'a') as file_object: #1
    file_object.write("I also love finding meaning in large datasets.\n") #2_hello_world
    file_object.write("I love creating apps that can run in a browser.\n")

'''
At #1 we use the 'a' argument to open the file for appending rather than writing over the existing 
file. At #2_hello_world we write two new lines, which are added to programming.txt:

I love programming.
I love creating new games.
I also love finding meaning in large datasets.
I love creating apps that can run in a browser.
'''

'''
We end up with the original contents of the file, followed by the new content we just added.
