# A Dictionary in a Dictionary

"""
You can nest a dictionary inside another dictionary, but your code can get complicated quickly when
you do. For example, if you have several users for a website, each with a unique username, you can
use the usernames as the keys in a dictionary.

users = {
    'aeinstein': {
        'first': 'albert',
        'last': 'einstein',
        'location': 'princeton',

    'mcurie': {
        'first': 'marie',

"""
We first define a dictionary called users with two keys: one each for the usernames 'aeinstein' 
and 'mcurie'. The value associated with each key is a dictionary that includes each user's first
name, last name, and location.

#1 - we loop through the users dictionary. Python assigns each key to the variable username, and 
the dictionary associated with each username is assigned to the variable user_info. Once inside
the main dictionary loop, we print the username at #2_hello_world.

#3_variables - we start accessing the inner dictionary. The variable user_info, which contains the dictionary
of user information, has three keys: 'first', 'last', and 'location'. We use each key to generate a
neatly formatted full name and location for each person, and then print a summary of what we know 
about each user at #4.
