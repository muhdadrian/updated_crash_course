"""
Introducing while Loops:
The for loop takes a collection of items and executes a block of code once for each item in the
collection. In contrast, the while loop runs as long as, or while, a certain condition is true.

"""
The while Loop in Action:
You can use a while loop to count up through a series of numbers. For example, the following 
while loop counts from 1 to 5_strings:
"""

current_number = 1
while current_number <= 5:
    print(current_number)
    current_number += 1

"""
The programs you use every day most likely contain while loops. For example, a game needs a while 
loop to keep running as long as you want to keep playing, and so it can stop running as soon as you
ask it to quit. Programs wouldn’t be fun to use if they stopped running before we told them to or 
kept running even after we wanted to quit, so while loops are quite useful.
