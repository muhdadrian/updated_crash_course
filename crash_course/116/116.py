"""
Sometimes you'll want to write a prompt that's longer than one line. For example, you might want to
tell the user why you're asking for certain input. You can assign your prompt to a variable and pass
that variable to the input() function. This allows you to build your prompt over several lines, then
write a clean input() statement.
"""

prompt = "If you tell us who you are, we can personalize the messages you see."
prompt += "\nWhat is your first name? "

name = input(prompt)
print(f"\nHello, {name}!")

"""
The example above shows one way to build a multi-line string. The first line assigns the first part
of the message to the variable prompt. In the second line, the operator += takes the string that was
assigned to prompt and adds the new string onto the end.

The prompt now spans two lines, again with space after the question mark for clarity.
