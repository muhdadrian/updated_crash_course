'''
We name this new method test_first_last_middle_name(). The method name must start with test_ so 
the method runs automatically when we run test_name_function.py. We name the method to make it 
clear which behavior of get_formatted_name() we’re testing. As a result, if the test fails, we 
know right away what kinds of names are affected. It’s fine to have long method names in your 
TestCase classes. They need to be descriptive so you can make sense of the output when your tests 
fail, and because Python calls them automatically, you’ll never have to write code that calls 
these methods.

To test the function, we call get_formatted_name() with a first, last, and middle name #1, and 
then we use assertEqual() to check that the returned full name matches the full name (first, 
middle, and last) that we expect. When we run test_name_function.py again, both tests pass:

OK

Great! We now know that the function still works for names like Janis Joplin, and we can be 
confident that it will work for names like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart as well.
