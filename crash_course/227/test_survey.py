'''
We call the new method test_store_three_responses(). We create a survey object just like we did in 
test_store_single_response(). We define a list containing three different responses #1, and then 
we call store_response() for each of these responses. Once the responses have been stored, we 
write another loop and assert that each response is now in my_survey.responses #2.

When we run test_survey.py again, both tests (for a single response and for three responses) pass:

OK

This works perfectly. However, these tests are a bit repetitive, so we’ll use another feature of 
unittest to make them more efficient.
