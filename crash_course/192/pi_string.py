The variable pi_string contains the whitespace that was on the left side of the digits in each
line, but we can get rid of that by using strip() instead of rstrip():
'''

filename = 'pi_digits.txt'

with open(filename) as file_object:
    lines = file_object.readlines()

pi_string = ''
for line in lines:
    pi_string += line.strip()

print(pi_string)
print(len(pi_string))

'''
Now we have a string containing pi to 30 decimal places. The string is 32 characters long because
it also includes the leading 3_variables and a decimal point:
