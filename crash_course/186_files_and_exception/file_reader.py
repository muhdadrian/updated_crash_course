The first line of this program has a lot going on. Let’s start by looking at the open() function. 
To do any work with a file, even just printing its contents, you first need to open the file to 
access it. The open() function needs one argument: the name of the file you want to open. Python 
looks for this file in the directory where the program that’s currently being executed is stored.
 
In this example, pi_string.py is currently running, so Python looks for pi_million_digits.txt in the 
directory where pi_string.py is stored. The open() function returns an object representing the 
file. Here, open('pi_million_digits.txt') returns an object representing pi_million_digits.txt. 
Python assigns this object to file_object, which we’ll work with later in the program.

The keyword with closes the file once access to it is no longer needed. Notice how we call open() 
in this program but not close(). You could open and close the file by calling open() and close(), 
but if a bug in your program prevents the close() method from being executed, the file may never 
close. This may seem trivial, but improperly closed files can cause data to be lost or corrupted.
 
And if you call close() too early in your program, you’ll find yourself trying to work with a closed 
file (a file you can’t access), which leads to more errors. It’s not always easy to know exactly 
when you should close a file, but with the structure shown here, Python will figure that out for 
you. All you have to do is open the file and work with it as desired, trusting that Python will 
close it automatically when the with block finishes execution.

Once we have a file object representing pi_million_digits.txt, we use the read() method in the second line
of our program to read the entire contents of the file and store it as one long string in contents.
When we print the value of contents, we get the entire text file back:
