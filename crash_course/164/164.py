# Creating Multiple Instances
# You can create as many instances from a class as you need. Let’s create a second dog called your_dog:

class Dog:
    """A simple attempt to model a dog."""

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        """Initialize name and age attributes."""
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def sit(self):
        """Simulate a dog sitting in response to a command."""
        print(f"{self.name} is now sitting.")

    def roll_over(self):
        """Simulate rolling over in response to a command."""
        print(f"{self.name} rolled over!")

my_dog = Dog('Willie', 6)
your_dog = Dog('Lucy', 3)

print(f"My dog's name is {my_dog.name}.")
print(f"My dog is {my_dog.age} years old.")
my_dog.sit()

print(f"\nYour dog's name is {your_dog.name}.")
print(f"Your dog is {your_dog.age} years old.")
your_dog.sit()

"""
Even if we used the same name and age for the second dog, Python would still create a separate 
instance from the Dog class. You can make as many instances from one class as you need, as long as 
you give each instance a unique variable name or it occupies a unique spot in a list or dictionary.
