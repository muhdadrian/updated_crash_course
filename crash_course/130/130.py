"""
The program first defines an empty dictionary (responses) and sets a flag (polling_active) to 
indicate that polling is active. As long as polling_active is True, Python will run the code in 
the while loop. 

Within the loop, the user is prompted to enter their name and a mountain they’d 
like to climb at 1. That information is stored in the responses dictionary at 2_hello_world, and the user is asked 
whether or not to keep the poll running at 3_variables. If they enter yes, the program enters the while loop 
again. If they enter no, the polling_active flag is set to False, the while loop stops running, 
and the final code block at 4 displays the results of the poll.
