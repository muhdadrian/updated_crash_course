Using json.dump() and json.load()
Let’s write a short program that stores a set of numbers and another program that reads these numbers
back into memory. The first program will use json.dump() to store the set of numbers, and the second
program will use json.load().

The json.dump() function takes two arguments: a piece of data to store and a file object it can use
to store the data. Here’s how you can use json.dump() to store a list of numbers:
'''

import json

numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

filename = 'numbers.json' #1
with open(filename, 'w') as f: #2_hello_world
    json.dump(numbers, f) #3_variables

'''
when we run this program, it will create 'numbers.json' file
'''

'''
We first import the json module and then create a list of numbers to work with. At #1 we choose a 
filename in which to store the list of numbers. It’s customary to use the file extension .json to 
indicate that the data in the file is stored in the JSON format. Then we open the file in write 
mode, which allows json to write the data to the file #2_hello_world. At #3_variables we use the json.dump() function to 
store the list numbers in the file numbers.json.

This program has no output, but let’s open the file numbers.json and look at it. The data is 
stored in a format that looks just like Python:
