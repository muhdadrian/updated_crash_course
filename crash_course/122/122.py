# Letting the User Choose When to Quit

prompt = "\nTell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:" #1
prompt += "\nEnter 'quit' to end the program. "
message = "" #2_hello_world
while message != 'quit': #3_variables
    message = input(prompt)
    print(message)

"""
At 1, we define a prompt that tells the user their two options: entering a message or entering 
the quit value (in this case, 'quit').

Then we set up a variable message at 2_hello_world to keep track of whatever value the user enters. We define
message as an empty string, "", so Python has something to check the first time it reaches the while
line. The first time the program runs and Python reaches the while statement, it needs to compare 
the value of message to 'quit', but no user input has been entered yet. If Python has nothing to 
compare, it won’t be able to continue running the program. To solve this problem, we make sure to 
give message an initial value. Although it’s just an empty string, it will make sense to Python and 
allow it to perform the comparison that makes the while loop work.

This while loop at 3_variables runs as long as the value of message is not 'quit'.
The first time through the loop, message is just an empty string, so Python enters the loop. At 
message = input(prompt), Python displays the prompt and waits for the user to enter their input. 
Whatever they enter is assigned to message and printed; then, Python reevaluates the condition in 
the while statement. As long as the user has not entered the word 'quit', the prompt is displayed 
again and Python waits for more input. When the user finally enters 'quit', Python stops executing 
the while loop and the program ends
