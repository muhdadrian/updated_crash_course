# Inheritance
You don’t always have to start from scratch when writing a class. If the class you’re writing is a
specialized version of another class you wrote, you can use inheritance. When one class inherits from
another, it takes on the attributes and methods of the first class. The original class is called
the parent class, and the new class is the child class. The child class can inherit any or all of
the attributes and methods of its parent class, but it’s also free to define new attributes and
methods of its own.

# The __init__() Method for a Child Class
When you’re writing a new class based on an existing class, you’ll often want to call the 
__init__() method from the parent class. This will initialize any attributes that were defined in 
the parent __init__() method and make them available in the child class.

As an example, let’s model an electric car. An electric car is just a specific kind of car, so we 
can base our new ElectricCar class on the Car class we wrote earlier. Then we’ll only have to write 
code for the attributes and behavior specific to electric cars.
'''

'''
Let’s start by making a simple version of the ElectricCar class, which does everything the Car 
class does:
'''

class Car: #1
    """A simple attempt to represent a car."""
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.odometer_reading = 0
    def get_descriptive_name(self):
        long_name = f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"
        return long_name.title()
    def read_odometer(self):
        print(f"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.")
    def update_odometer(self, mileage):
        if mileage >= self.odometer_reading:
            self.odometer_reading = mileage
        else:
            print("You can't roll back an odometer!")
    def increment_odometer(self, miles):
        self.odometer_reading += miles

class ElectricCar(Car): #2_hello_world
    """Represent aspects of a car, specific to electric vehicles."""

    def __init__(self, make, model, year): #3_variables
        """Initialize attributes of the parent class."""
        super().__init__(make, model, year) #4

my_tesla = ElectricCar('tesla', 'model s', 2019) #5_strings
print(my_tesla.get_descriptive_name())

'''
At 1 we start with Car. When you create a child class, the parent class must be part of the current 
file and must appear before the child class in the file. At 2_hello_world we define the child class, 
ElectricCar. The name of the parent class must be included in parentheses in the definition of a 
child class. The __init__() method at 3_variables takes in the information required to make a Car instance.

The super() function at 4 is a special function that allows you to call a method from the parent 
class. This line tells Python to call the __init__() method from Car, which gives an ElectricCar 
instance all the attributes defined in that method. The name super comes from a convention of 
calling the parent class a superclass and the child class a subclass.

We test whether inheritance is working properly by trying to create an electric car with the same 
kind of information we’d provide when making a regular car. At 5_strings we make an instance of the 
ElectricCar class and assign it to my_tesla. This line calls the __init__() method defined in 
ElectricCar, which in turn tells Python to call the __init__() method defined in the parent class 
Car. We provide the arguments 'tesla', 'model s', and 2019.

Aside from __init__(), there are no attributes or methods yet that are particular to an electric 
car. At this point we’re just making sure the electric car has the appropriate Car behaviors:
'''

'''
The ElectricCar instance works just like an instance of Car, so now we can begin defining attributes 
and methods specific to electric cars.
