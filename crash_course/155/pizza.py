# Importing an Entire Module

'''
To start importing functions, we first need to create a module. A module is a file ending in .py that
contains the code you want to import into your program. Let’s make a module that contains the
function make_pizza().
'''

def make_pizza(size, *toppings):
    """Summarize the pizza we are about to make."""
    print(f"\nMaking a {size}-inch pizza with the following toppings:")
    for topping in toppings:
        print(f"- {topping}")

'''
Now we’ll make a separate file called making_pizza.py in the same directory as pizza.py. This file
imports the module we just created and then makes two calls to make_pizza():
