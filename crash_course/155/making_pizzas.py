When Python reads this file, the line import pizza tells Python to open the file pizza.py and copy 
all the functions from it into this program. You don’t actually see code being copied between files 
because Python copies the code behind the scenes just before the program runs. All you need to know 
is that any function defined in pizza.py will now be available in making_pizzas.py.

To call a function from an imported module, enter the name of the module you imported, pizza, 
followed by the name of the function, make_pizza(), separated by a dot at 1. This code produces the 
same output as the original program that didn’t import a module:

This first approach to importing, in which you simply write import followed by the name of the 
module, makes every function from the module available in your program. If you use this kind of 
import statement to import an entire module named module_name.py, each function in the module is 
available through the following syntax:

module_name.function_name()
