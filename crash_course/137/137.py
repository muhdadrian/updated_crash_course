"""
Note that the order of the parameters in the function definition had to be changed. Because the 
default value makes it unnecessary to specify a type of animal as an argument, the only argument 
left in the function call is the pet’s name. Python still interprets this as a positional argument,
so if the function is called with just a pet’s name, that argument will match up with the first 
parameter listed in the function’s definition. This is the reason the first parameter needs to be
pet_name.
