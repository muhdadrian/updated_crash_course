# The Python Standard Library
The Python standard library is a set of modules included with every Python installation. Now that
you have a basic understanding of how functions and classes work, you can start to use modules
like these that other programmers have written.

You can use any function or class in the standard library by including a simple import statement
at the top of your file. Let’s look at one module, random, which can be useful in modeling many
real-world situations.

One interesting function from the random module is randint(). This function takes two integer
arguments and returns a randomly selected integer between (and including) those numbers.

Here’s how to generate a random number between 1 and 6:
'''

from random import randint

print(randint(1, 6))
