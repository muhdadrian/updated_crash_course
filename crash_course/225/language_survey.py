'''
To show that the AnonymousSurvey class works, let’s write a program that uses the class:
'''

from survey import AnonymousSurvey

# Define a question, and make a survey.
question = "What language did you first learn to speak?"
my_survey = AnonymousSurvey(question)

# Show the question, and store responses to the question.
my_survey.show_question()
print("Enter 'q' at any time to quit.\n")
while True:
    response = input("Language: ")
    if response == 'q':
        break
    my_survey.store_response(response)

# Show the survey results.
print("\nThank you to everyone who participated in the survey!")
my_survey.show_results()

'''
This program defines a question ("What language did you first learn to speak?") and creates an 
AnonymousSurvey object with that question. The program calls show_question() to display the 
question and then prompts for responses. Each response is stored as it is received. When all 
responses have been entered (the user inputs q to quit), show_results() prints the survey results:

What language did you first learn to speak?
Enter 'q' at any time to quit.

Language: English 
Language: Spanish 
Language: English 
Language: Mandarin 
Language: q

Thank you to everyone who participated in the survey!
Survey results:
- English
- Spanish
- English
- Mandarin

This class works for a simple anonymous survey. But let’s say we want to improve AnonymousSurvey 
and the module it’s in, survey. We could allow each user to enter more than one response. We could 
write a method to list only unique responses and to report how many times each response was given. 
We could write another class to manage nonanonymous surveys.

Implementing such changes would risk affecting the current behavior of the class AnonymousSurvey. 
For example, it’s possible that while trying to allow each user to enter multiple responses, we 
could accidentally change how single responses are handled. To ensure we don’t break existing 
behavior as we develop this module, we can write tests for the class.

ChatGPT

my_survey = AnonymousSurvey(question)

AnonymousSurvey(question): This is a call to the constructor method __init__ of the 
AnonymousSurvey class. This constructor method is defined with def __init__(self, question):. 
It initializes a new instance of the AnonymousSurvey class. The question parameter is passed to 
this constructor method, allowing you to specify the survey question when creating a new survey 
object.

my_survey: This is a variable name chosen to refer to the instance of the AnonymousSurvey class 
that is created by calling the constructor. By assigning the result of the constructor call to 
my_survey, you're creating a new instance of the AnonymousSurvey class and storing it in this 
variable. This variable can then be used to interact with the methods and properties of the 
AnonymousSurvey object.

my_survey.show_question()

my_survey: This refers to the instance of the AnonymousSurvey class that was created earlier. Since 
my_survey now holds an instance of AnonymousSurvey, you can call its methods.

show_question(): This is a method defined within the AnonymousSurvey class. When called on an 
instance of AnonymousSurvey, it prints the survey question to the console. This method simply 
displays the survey question stored in the instance.

So, these two lines of code together create a new AnonymousSurvey object with a specified question 
and then display that question to the user.
