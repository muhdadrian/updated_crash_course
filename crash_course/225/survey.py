A Class to Test
Testing a class is similar to testing a function—much of your work involves testing the behavior of
the methods in the class. But there are a few differences, so let’s write a class to test.
Consider a class that helps administer anonymous surveys:
'''

class AnonymousSurvey:
    """Collect anonymous answers to a survey question."""

    def __init__(self, question): #1
        """Store a question, and prepare to store responses."""
        self.question = question
        self.responses = []

    def show_question(self): #2
        """Show the survey question."""
        print(self.question)

    def store_response(self, new_response): #3
        """Store a single response to the survey."""
        self.responses.append(new_response)

    def show_results(self): #4
        """Show all the responses that have been given."""
        print("Survey results:")
        for response in self.responses:
            print(f"- {response}")

'''
This class starts with a survey question that you provide #1 and includes an empty list to store 
responses. The class has methods to print the survey question #2, add a new response to the response 
list #3, and print all the responses stored in the list #4. To create an instance from this class, 
all you have to provide is a question. Once you have an instance representing a particular 
survey, you display the survey question with show_question(), store a response using store_
response(), and show results with show_results().
