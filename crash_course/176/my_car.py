'''
we make a separate file called my_car.py. This file will import the Car class and then create an
instance from that class:
'''

from car import Car #1

my_new_car = Car('audi', 'a4', 2019)
print(my_new_car.get_descriptive_name())

my_new_car.odometer_reading = 23
my_new_car.read_odometer()

'''
The import statement at #1 tells Python to open the car module and import the class Car. Now we can 
use the Car class as if it were defined in this file. The output is the same as we saw earlier:

2019 Audi A4
This car has 23 miles on it.
'''

Importing classes is an effective way to program. Picture how long this program file would be if 
the entire Car class were included. When you instead move the class to a module and import the 
module, you still get all the same functionality, but you keep your main program file clean and easy 
to read. You also store most of the logic in separate files; once your classes work as you want them 
to, you can leave those files alone and focus on the higher-level logic of your main program.
