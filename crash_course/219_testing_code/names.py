This program imports get_formatted_name() from name_function.py. The user can enter a series of 
first and last names, and see the formatted full names that are generated:

Enter 'q' at any time to quit.

Please give me a first name: janis 
Please give me a last name: joplin
        Neatly formatted name: Janis Joplin.

Please give me a first name: bob 
Please give me a last name: dylan
    Neatly formatted name: Bob Dylan. 
    
Please give me a first name: q

We can see that the names generated here are correct. But let’s say we want to modify 
get_formatted_name() so it can also handle middle names. As we do so, we want to make sure we 
don’t break the way the function handles names that have only a first and last name. We could test 
our code by running test_name_function.py and entering a name like Janis Joplin every time we modify 
get_formatted_name(), but that would become tedious. 

Fortunately, test_name _function.py Python provides an efficient way to automate the testing of a 
function’s output. If we automate the testing of get_formatted_name(), we can always be confident 
that the function will work when given the kinds of names we’ve written tests for.
