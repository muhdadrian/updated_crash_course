# Modifying an Attribute’s Value Through a Method

'''
It can be helpful to have methods that update certain attributes for you. Instead of accessing the
attribute directly, you pass the new value to a method that handles the updating internally.
Here’s an example showing a method called update_odometer():
'''

class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        """Initialize attributes to describe a car."""
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.odometer_reading = 0

    def get_descriptive_name(self):
        """Return a neatly formatted descriptive name."""
        long_name = f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"
        return long_name.title()

    def read_odometer(self):
        """Print a statement showing the car's mileage."""
        print(f"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.")

    def update_odometer(self, mileage): #1
        """Set the odometer reading to the given value."""
        self.odometer_reading = mileage

my_new_car = Car('audi', 'a4', 2019)
print(my_new_car.get_descriptive_name())

my_new_car.update_odometer(23) #2_hello_world
my_new_car.read_odometer()

'''
The only modification to Car is the addition of update_odometer() at 1. This method takes in a 
mileage value and assigns it to self.odometer_reading. At 2_hello_world we call update_odometer() and give it 
23 as an argument (corresponding to the mileage parameter in the method definition). It sets the 
odometer reading to 23, and read_odometer() prints the reading:
