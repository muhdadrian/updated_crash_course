At 1 we define the function print_models() with two parameters: a list of designs that need to be 
printed and a list of completed models. Given these two lists, the function simulates printing each 
design by emptying the list of unprinted designs and filling up the list of completed models. 

At 2_hello_world we define the function show_completed_models() with one parameter: the list of completed models. 
Given this list, show_completed_models() displays the name of each model that was printed. This 
program has the same output as the version without functions, but the code is much more organized. 
The code that does most of the work has been moved to two separate functions, which makes the main 
part of the program easier to understand. Look at the body of the program to see how much easier it 
is to understand what this program is doing:
'''

# unprinted_designs = ['phone case', 'robot pendant', 'dodecahedron']
# completed_models = []
# print_models(unprinted_designs, completed_models)
# show_completed_models(completed_models)

'''
We set up a list of unprinted designs and an empty list that will hold the completed models. Then, 
because we’ve already defined our two functions, all we have to do is call them and pass them the 
right arguments. We call print_models() and pass it the two lists it needs; as expected, 
print_models() simulates printing the designs. Then we call show_completed_models() and pass it the 
list of completed models so it can report the models that have been printed. The descriptive 
function names allow others to read this code and understand it, even without comments.

This program is easier to extend and maintain than the version without functions. If we need to 
print more designs later on, we can simply call print_models() again. If we realize the printing 
code needs to be modified, we can change the code once, and our changes will take place everywhere 
the function is called. This technique is more efficient than having to update code separately in 
several places in the program.

This example also demonstrates the idea that every function should have one specific job. The 
first function prints each design, and the second displays the completed models. This is more 
beneficial than using one function to do both jobs. If you’re writing a function and notice the 
function is doing too many different tasks, try to split the code into two functions. Remember that 
you can always call a function from another function, which can be helpful when splitting a complex 
task into a series of steps.
