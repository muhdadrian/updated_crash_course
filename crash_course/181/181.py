# Importing a Module into a Module

Sometimes you’ll want to spread out your classes over several modules to keep any one file from
growing too large and avoid storing unrelated classes in the same module. When you store your classes
in several modules, you may find that a class in one module depends on a class in another module.
When this happens, you can import the required class into the first module.

For example, let’s store the Car class in one module and the ElectricCar and Battery classes in a
separate module. We’ll make a new module called electric_car.py — replacing the electric_car.py file
we created earlier — and copy just the Battery and ElectricCar classes into this file:
