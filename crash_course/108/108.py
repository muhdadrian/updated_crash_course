Because we want to modify the first three aliens, we loop through a slice that includes only the 
first three aliens. All of the aliens are green now but that won't always be the case, so we write 
an if statement to make sure we're only modifying green aliens. If the alien is green, we change the
color to 'yellow', the speed to 'medium', and the point value to 10, as shown in the output.
