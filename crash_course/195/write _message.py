#Writing to a File
One of the simplest ways to save data is to write it to a file. When you write text to a file, the
output will still be available after you close the terminal containing your program’s output. You can
examine output after a program finishes running, and you can share the output files with others as
well. You can also write programs that read the text back into memory and work with it again later.

#Writing to an Empty File
To write text to a file, you need to call open() with a second argument telling Python that you want
to write to the file. To see how this works, let’s write a simple message and store it in a file
instead of printing it to the screen:
'''

filename = 'programming.txt'

with open(filename, 'w') as file_object: #1
    file_object.write("I love programming.") #2_hello_world

'''
The call to open() in this example has two arguments #1. The first argument is still the name of the
file we want to open. The second argument, 'w', tells Python that we want to open the file in write
mode. You can open a file in read mode ('r'), write mode ('w'), append mode ('a'), or a mode that
allows you to read and write to the file ('r+'). If you omit the mode argument, Python opens the 
file in read-only mode by default.

The open() function automatically creates the file you’re writing to if it doesn’t already exist. 
However, be careful opening a file in write mode ('w') because if the file does exist, Python will 
erase the contents of the file before returning the file object.

At #2_hello_world we use the write() method on the file object to write a string to the file. This program has 
no terminal output, but if you open the file programming.txt, you’ll see one line:

I love programming.

This file behaves like any other file on your computer. You can open it, write new text in it, 
copy from it, paste to it, and so forth.

Python can only write strings to a text file. If you want to store numerical data in a text file, 
you’ll have to convert the data to string format first using the str() function.
