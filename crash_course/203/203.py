Handling the FileNotFoundError Exception
One common issue when working with files is handling missing files. The file you’re looking for might
be in a different location, the filename may be misspelled, or the file may not exist at all. You can
handle all of these situations in a straightforward way with a try-except block.
Let’s try to read a file that doesn’t exist. The following program tries to read in the contents of
Alice in Wonderland, but I haven’t saved the file alice.txt in the same directory as alice.py:
'''

filename = 'alice.txt'
with open(filename, encoding='utf-8') as f:
    contents = f.read()

'''
There are two changes here. One is the use of the variable f to represent the file object, which is
a common convention. The second is the use of the encoding argument. This argument is needed when 
your system’s default encoding doesn’t match the encoding of the file that’s being read.
Python can’t read from a missing file, so it raises an exception:
'''

'''
The last line of the traceback reports a FileNotFoundError: this is the exception Python creates 
when it can’t find the file it’s trying to open.
