'''
The setUp() Method
In test_survey.py we created a new instance of AnonymousSurvey in each test method, and we created
new responses in each method. The unittest.TestCase class has a setUp() method that allows you to
create these objects once and then use them in each of your test methods. When you include a
setUp() method in a TestCase class, Python runs the setUp() method before running each method
starting with test_. Any objects created in the setUp() method are then available in each test
method you write.

Let’s use setUp() to create a survey instance and a set of responses that can be used in
test_store_single_response() and test_store_three_responses():
'''

import unittest
from survey import AnonymousSurvey

class TestAnonymousSurvey(unittest.TestCase):
    """Tests for the class AnonymousSurvey"""

    def setUp(self):
        """
        Create a survey and a set of responses for use in all test methods.
        """
        question = "What language did you first learn to speak?"
        self.my_survey = AnonymousSurvey(question) #1
        self.responses = ['English', 'Spanish', 'Mandarin'] #2

    def test_store_single_response(self):
        """Test that a single response is stored properly."""
        self.my_survey.store_response(self.responses[0])
        self.assertIn(self.responses[0], self.my_survey.responses)

    def test_store_three_responses(self):
        """Test that three individual responses are stored properly."""
        for response in self.responses:
            self.my_survey.store_response(response)
        for response in self.responses:
            self.assertIn(response, self.my_survey.responses)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

'''
The method setUp() does two things: it creates a survey instance #1, and it creates a list of 
responses #2. Each of these is prefixed by self, so they can be used anywhere in the class. This 
makes the two test methods simpler, because neither one has to make a survey instance or a 
response. The method test_store_single_response() verifies that the first response in 
self.responses—self.responses[0]—can be stored correctly, and test_store _three_responses() 
verifies that all three responses in self.responses can be stored correctly.
When we run test_survey.py again, both tests still pass. These tests would be particularly useful 
when trying to expand AnonymousSurvey to handle multiple responses for each person. After 
modifying the code to accept multiple responses, you could run these tests and make sure you 
haven’t affected the ability to store a single response or a series of individual responses.
When you’re testing your own classes, the setUp() method can make your test methods easier to 
write. You make one set of instances and attributes in setUp() and then use these instances in 
all your test methods. This is much easier than making a new set of instances and attributes in 
each test method.

'''
When a test case is running, Python prints one character for each unit test as it is completed. A 
passing test prints a dot, a test that results in an error prints an E, and a test that results in 
a failed assertion prints an F. This is why you’ll see a different number of dots and characters on 
the first line of output when you run your test cases. If a test case takes a long time to run 
because it contains many unit tests, you can watch these results to get a sense of how many tests 
are passing.
