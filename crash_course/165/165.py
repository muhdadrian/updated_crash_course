At 1 in the Car class, we define the __init__() method with the self parameter first, just like we did 
before with our Dog class. We also give it three other parameters: make, model, and year. 
The __init__() method takes in these parameters and assigns them to the attributes that will be 
associated with instances made from this class. When we make a new Car instance, we’ll need to 
specify a make, model, and year for our instance.

At 2_hello_world we define a method called get_descriptive_name() that puts a car’s year, make, and model into 
one string neatly describing the car. This will spare us from having to print each attribute’s value 
individually. To work with the attribute values in this method, we use self.make, self.model, and 
self.year. 

At 3_variables we make an instance from the Car class and assign it to the variable my_new_car. Then we call 
get_descriptive_name() to show what kind of car we have:
