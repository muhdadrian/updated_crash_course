# Starting with an Empty Dictionary:

# It's sometimes convenient, or even necessary, to start with an empty dictionary and then add each
# new item to it. To start filling an empty dictionary, define a dictionary with an empty set of
# braces and then add each key-value pair on its own line.


alien_0 = {}

alien_0['color'] = 'green'
alien_0['points'] = 5

print(alien_0)

# Typically, you'll use empty dictionaries when storing user-supplied data in a dictionary or when
# you write code that generates a large number of key-value pairs automatically.
