# You can also test to see if two numbers are not equal. For example, the following code
# prints a message if the given answer is not correct:


answer = 17
if answer != 42:
    print("That is not the correct answer. Please try again!")

# The conditional test passes, because the value of answer (17) is not equal to 42. Because the test
# passes, the following or indented code block above is executed
