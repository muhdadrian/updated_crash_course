# Modifying Attribute Values
'''
You can change an attribute’s value in three ways: you can change the value directly through an
instance, set the value through a method, or increment the value (add a certain amount to it) through
a method. Let’s look at each of these approaches.

class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        """Initialize attributes to describe a car."""
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.odometer_reading = 0

    def get_descriptive_name(self):
        """Return a neatly formatted descriptive name."""
        long_name = f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"
        return long_name.title()

    def read_odometer(self):
        """Print a statement showing the car's mileage."""
        print(f"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.")

my_new_car = Car('audi', 'a4', 2019)
print(my_new_car.get_descriptive_name())

my_new_car.odometer_reading = 23 #1
my_new_car.read_odometer()

'''
At 1 we use dot notation to access the car’s odometer_reading attribute and set its value 
directly. This line tells Python to take the instance my_new_car, find the attribute odometer_reading 
associated with it, and set the value of that attribute to 23:

Sometimes you’ll want to access attributes directly like this, but other times you’ll want to write 
a method that updates the value for you.
