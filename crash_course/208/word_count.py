Now we can write a simple loop to count the words in any text we want to analyze. We do this by
storing the names of the files we want to analyze in a list, and then we call count_words() for
each file in the list. We’ll try to count the words for Syukuri, Tiada, Learn, and Tujuan Hidup,
which are all available in the public domain. I’ve intentionally left tiada.txt out of the
directory containing word_count.py, so we can see how well our program handles a missing file:
'''
def count_words(filename):
    """Count the approximate number of words in a file.""" #1
    try:
        with open(filename, encoding='utf-8') as f:
            contents = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Sorry, the file {filename} does not exist.")
    else:
        words = contents.split()
        num_words = len(words)
        print(f"The file {filename} has about {num_words} words.")


filenames = ['syukuri.txt', 'tiada.txt', 'learn.txt', 'tujuan_hidup.txt']
for filename in filenames:
    count_words(filename)

'''
The missing tiada.txt file has no effect on the rest of the program’s execution:
'''

'''
Using the try-except block in this example provides two significant advantages. We prevent our 
users from seeing a traceback, and we let the program continue analyzing the texts it’s able to 
find. If we don’t catch the FileNotFoundError that tiada.txt raised, the user would see a 
full traceback, and the program would stop running after trying to analyze Tiada. It would 
never analyze Learn or Tujuan Hidup.
