# A Class to Test

# Testing a class is similar to testing a function, because much of the work involves testing the behavior of the methods in the class. However, there are a few differences, so let’s write a class to test. Consider a class that helps administer anonymous surveys:


class AnonymousSurvey:
    """Collect anonymous answers to a survey question."""

    def __init__(self, question):  # 1
        """Store a question, and prepare to store responses."""
        self.question = question
        self.responses = []

    def show_question(self):  # 2
        """Show the survey question."""
        print(self.question)

    def store_response(self, new_response):  # 3
        """Store a single response to the survey."""
        self.responses.append(new_response)

    def show_results(self):  # 4
        """Show all the responses that have been given."""
        print("Survey results:")
        for response in self.responses:
            print(f"- {response}")


# This class starts with a survey question that you provide ❶ and includes an empty list to store responses.
# The class has methods to print the survey question ❷, add a new response to the response list ❸, and print all the responses stored in the list ❹.
# To create an instance from this class, all you have to provide is a question. Once you have an instance representing a particular survey, you display the survey question with show_question(), store a response using store_response(), and show results with show_results().
# To show that the AnonymousSurvey class works, let’s write a program that uses the class at language_survey.py
