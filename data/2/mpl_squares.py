"""
- we first import the pyplot module.
- pyplot module contains a number of functions that generate charts and plots.
- we create a list called squares to hold the data that we'll plot.
- we follow another common Matplotlib convention by calling the subplots() function. This function
can generate one or more plots in the same figure.
- the var fig represents entire figure or collection of plots that are generated.
- the var ax represents a single plot in the figure and is the var we'll use most of the time.
- we then use the plot()  method, which will try to plot the data it's given in a meaningful way.
- the function plt.show() opens Matplotlib's viewer and displays the plot.
